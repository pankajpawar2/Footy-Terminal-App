## Terminal App - FOOTYHUB
Features implemented:
  * Check History of the Game
  * Learn about rules of the game
  * Display Clubs list
  * Display championships won for a particular team
  * Provide data in the form of Pie chart
  * Take Footy knowldge quiz
  
While i am implementing the features, I am doing manual testing to check if there are any errors in the terminal app. I am updating my to-do list using Trello to keep track of things to do. 

Things to be completed:
 * Software development plan documentation
 * Adding new feature to store user quiz score
 * Error Handling

Please let me know if i need to add anything. Any help from your side will be appreciated.
